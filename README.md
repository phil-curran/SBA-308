# Gradebook Calculator

## Description:

This program takes in several data objects (Course Info, Assignment Group, and Learner submissions) and calculates several datapoints regarding student grades; specifically, grade percentages on each submitted and due assignment, plus a running average of the cumulative grade.

It uses several descriptively-named helper functions, and object destructuring, to make the code easier to read. I've also included extensive notes that describe what each portion of the code does.
